## Updating the State

All states are internally updated by ngrx-forms through dispatching actions. While this is of course also possible for you there exist a set of utility functions that can be used to update states. This is mainly useful to change the state as a result of a different action in your reducer. Note that ngrx-forms is coded in such a way that no state references will change if nothing inside the state changes. It is therefore perfectly safe to repeatedly call any of the functions below and the state will be updated exactly once or not at all if nothing changed. Each function can be imported from `ngrx-forms`. The following table explains each function:

|Function|Description|
|-|-|
|`setValue`|This curried function takes a value and returns a function that takes a state and updates the value of the state. Note that setting the value of a group or array will also update all children including adding and removing children on the fly for added/removed properties/items. Setting the value of a control to a new value will also mark that control as dirty. Has an uncurried overload that takes a state directly as the second parameter.|
|`validate`|This curried function takes either a single validation function or an array of validation functions as a parameter and returns a function that takes a state and updates the errors of the state with the result of the provided validation function applied to the state's value. Has an uncurried overload that takes a state directly as the second parameter.|
|`setErrors`|This curried function takes either a single error object or an array of error objects as a parameter and returns a function that takes a state and updates the errors of the state. Has an uncurried overload that takes a state directly as the second parameter.|
|`enable`|This function takes a state and enables it. For groups and arrays this also recursively enables all children.|
|`disable`|This function takes a state and disables it. For groups and arrays this also recursively disables all children. Disabling a control will clear all of its errors (i.e. making it always valid) and will remove all pending validations (thereby effectively cancelling those validations).|
|`markAsDirty`|This function takes a state and marks it as dirty. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as dirty.|
|`markAsPristine`|This function takes a state and marks it as pristine. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as pristine.|
|`markAsTouched`|This function takes a state and marks it as touched. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as touched.|
|`markAsUntouched`|This function takes a state and marks it as untouched. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as untouched.|
|`markAsSubmitted`|This function takes a state and marks it as submitted. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as submitted.|
|`markAsUnsubmitted`|This function takes a state and marks it as unsubmitted. For groups and arrays this also recursively marks all children as unsubmitted.|
|`focus`|This function takes a control state and makes it focused (which will also `.focus()` the form element).|
|`unfocus`|This function takes a control state and makes it unfocused (which will also `.blur()` the form element).|
|`addControl`|This curried function takes a name and a value and returns a function that takes a group state and adds a child control with the given name and value to the state.|
|`removeControl`|This curried function takes a name and returns a function that takes a group state and removes a child control with the given name from the state.|
|`setUserDefinedProperty`|This curried function takes a name and a value and returns a function that takes a state and sets the property with the given name to the given value on the state's user defined properties.|

These are the basic functions that perform simple updates on states. The functions below contain the real magic that allows easily updating deeply nested form states.

#### `updateArray`
This curried function takes an update function and returns a function that takes an array state, applies the provided update function to each element and recomputes the state of the array afterwards. As with all the functions above this function does not change the reference of the array if the update function does not change any children. See the section below for an example of how this function can be used.

#### `updateGroup`
This curried function takes a partial object in the shape of the group's value where each key contains an update function for that child and returns a function that takes a group state, applies all the provided update functions recursively and recomputes the state of the group afterwards. As with all the functions above this function does not change the reference of the group if none of the child update functions change any children. The best example of how this can be used is simple validation:

```typescript
import { updateArray, updateGroup, validate } from 'ngrx-forms';

export interface NestedValue {
  someNumber: number;
}

export interface MyFormValue {
  someTextInput: string;
  someCheckbox: boolean;
  nested: NestedValue;
  someNumbers: number[];
}

function required(value: any) {
  return !!value ? {} : { required: true };
}

function min(minValue: number) {
  return (value: number) => {
    return value >= minValue ? {} : { min: [value, minValue] };
  };
}

const updateMyFormGroup = updateGroup<MyFormValue>({
  someTextInput: validate(required),
  nested: updateGroup({
    someNumber: validate([required, min(2)]),
  }),
  someNumbers: updateArray(validate(min(3))),
});
```

The `updateMyFormGroup` function has a signature of `FormGroupState<MyFormValue> -> FormGroupState<MyFormValue>`. It takes a state, runs all validations, updates the errors, and returns the resulting state.

In addition, the `updateGroup` function allows specifying as many update function objects as you want and applies all of them after another. This is useful if you have dependencies between your update functions where one function's result may affect the result of another function. The following (contrived) example shows how to set the value of `someNumber` based on the `errors` of `someTextInput`.

```typescript
const updateMyFormGroup = updateGroup<MyFormValue>({
  someTextInput: validate(required),
  nested: updateGroup({
    someNumber: validate([required, min(2)]),
  }),
  someNumbers: updateArray(validate(min(3))),
}, {
  // note that the parent form state is provided as the second argument to update functions;
  // type annotations added for clarity but are inferred correctly otherwise
  nested: (nested: AbstractControlState<NestedValue>, myForm: FormGroupState<MyFormValue>) =>
    updateGroup<NestedValue>({
      someNumber: (someNumber: AbstractControlState<number>) => {
        if (myForm.controls.someTextInput.errors.required) {
          // sets the control's value to 1 and clears all errors
          return validate(() => ({}), setValue(1, someNumber));
        }

        return someNumber;
      };
    })(cast(nested))
    // the `cast` (utility function exported by `ngrx-forms`) helps the type checker to recognize the
    // `nested` state as a group state
});
```

#### `createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate`
This curried function combines a `formGroupReducer` and the `updateGroup` function by taking update objects of the same shape as `updateGroup` and returns a reducer which first calls the `formGroupReducer` and afterwards applies all update functions by calling `updateGroup`. Combining all we have seen so far our final reducer would therefore look something like this:

```typescript
export interface AppState {
  myForm: FormGroupState<MyFormValue>;
}

const FORM_ID = 'some globally unique string';

const initialFormState = createFormGroupState<MyFormValue>(FORM_ID, {
  someTextInput: '',
  someCheckbox: false,
  nested: {
    someNumber: 0,
  },
  someNumbers: [],
});

const initialState: AppState = {
  myForm: initialFormState,
};

const myFormReducer = createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate<MyFormValue>({
  someTextInput: validate(required),
  nested: updateGroup({
    someNumber: validate([required, min(2)]),
  }),
  someNumbers: updateArray(validate(min(3))),
}, {
  nested: (nested, myForm) =>
    updateGroup<NestedValue>({
      someNumber: someNumber => {
        if (myForm.controls.someTextInput.errors.required) {
          return validate(() => ({}), setValue(1, someNumber));
        }

        return someNumber;
      }
    })(cast(nested))
});

export function appReducer(state = initialState, action: Action): AppState {
  const myForm = myFormReducer(state.myForm, action);
  if (myForm !== state.myForm) {
    state = { ...state, myForm };
  }

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'some action type':
      // modify state
      return state;

    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

If you need to update the form state based on data not contained in the form state itself you can simply parameterize the form update function. In the following example we validate that `someNumber` is greater than some other number from the state.

```typescript
const createMyFormUpdateFunction = (otherNumber: number) => updateGroup<MyFormValue>({
  nested: updateGroup({
    otherNumber: validate(v => v > otherNumber ? {} : { tooSmall: otherNumber }),
  }),
});

export function appReducer(state = initialState, action: Action): AppState {
  let myForm = formGroupeReducer(state.myForm, action);
  myForm = createMyFormUpdateFunction(state.someOtherNumber)(myForm);
  if (myForm !== state.myForm) {
    state = { ...state, myForm };
  }

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'some action type':
      // modify state
      return state;

    case 'some action type of an action that changes `someOtherNumber`':
      // we need to update the form state as well since the parameters changed
      myForm = createMyFormUpdateFunction(action.someOtherNumber)(state.myForm);
      return {
        ...state,
        someOtherNumber: action.someOtherNumber,
        myForm,
      };

    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```

#### `updateRecursive`
Sometimes it is useful to apply an update function to all controls in a group or array recursively. This curried function takes an update function and returns a function that takes any state and applies the provided update function to all its children, its children's children etc. and finally to the state itself. This means when the update function is called for a certain state all of its children will have already been updated. The provided update function takes 2 parameters, the state to update and its parent state. For the top-level state the state itself is passed as the second parameter.

Below you can find an example of how this function can be used. In this example we want to block all form inputs temporarily (e.g. while submitting the form). This can be done by disabling the form state at the root. However, when we unblock all inputs we want their enabled/disabled state to be reset to what it was before blocking the inputs. This could be done by simply storing a complete copy of the state (which might take a lot of space depending on the size of the form state). However, the example below uses a different method. We use the `setUserDefinedProperty` update function to store the enabled/disabled state before blocking the inputs and later restore them to the state they were in.

```typescript
import { updateRecursive, setUserDefinedProperty, enable, disable, cast } from 'ngrx-forms';

export function appReducer(state = initialState, action: Action): AppState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'BLOCK_INPUTS': {
      let myForm = updateRecursive<MyFormValue>(s => setUserDefinedProperty('wasDisabled', s.isDisabled)(s))(state.myForm);
      myForm = disable(myForm);

      return {
        ...state,
        myForm: cast(myForm),
      };
    }

    case 'UNBLOCK_INPUTS': {
      let myForm = enable(state.myForm);
      myForm = updateRecursive<MyFormValue>(s => s.userDefinedProperties.wasDisabled ? disable(s) : s)(myForm);

      return {
        ...state,
        myForm: cast(myForm),
      };
    }

    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}
```
