## Ngrx Forms Changelog

<a name="2.0.0"></a>
### 2.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

* remove support for last keydown code tracking on form controls (this feature has been superseded by user defined properties which allow associating any kind of metadata with a control)
* rename `groupUpdateReducer` to `createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate` in order to make it clearer that the function itself is not a reducer
* remove erroneously exposed function `createChildState` from public API
* trying to set an error with a key prefixed with `$` will now throw an error since the `$` prefix is used to mark async errors

#### Features

* add support for arrays of form controls ([19d4e49](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/19d4e49))
* add value converter for object to JSON conversion ([2ba37ee](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/2ba37ee)) (thanks @tbroadley)
* add support for error composition by extending `validate` update function to take a single validation function or an array of validation functions ([ba976c5](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/ba976c5))
* add `setErrors` update function ([ee25ca8](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/ee25ca8))
* add `updateRecursive` update function (see the [documentation](docs/UPDATING_THE_STATE.md#updaterecursive) for a usage example) ([31f9d5d](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/31f9d5d))
* add common set of validation functions ([40308d4](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/40308d4))
* add support for user defined properties on form controls and groups ([d9778d2](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/commit/d9778d2))

<a name="1.1.0"></a>
### 1.1.0

<a name="1.0.2"></a>
### 1.0.2

#### Bugfixes

* add support for `ngValue` on `option` elements, thereby fixing non-string option values not working for `select` elements (thanks @nathanmarks for finding this issue)
* fix issue that prevents setting a value via state change if the same value was previously set via the view (thanks @nathanmarks for finding this issue)

<a name="1.0.1"></a>
### 1.0.1

#### Bugfixes

* fix issue that caused control state value to not be properly set to form element if the ID of the control state changed but the state's value was the same as the last value the view reported for the previous state
* changed form control state directive to run its initialization code inside the `ngAfterViewInit` hook instead of `ngOnInit` to allow proper interaction with form elements that can have dynamically rendered children they depend on (e.g. dynamic `option`s for `select`s) (thanks @nathanmarks for finding this issue)

<a name="1.0.0"></a>
### 1.0.0
